      ‚≠ê Opinion‚≠ê : On the other hand, Radix UI focuses on delivering low-level
      UI primitives. While it may not have as many pre-built components as
      Chakra UI, it gifts me the flexibility to construct more custom UI
      elements. I see Radix UI as a highly accessible and extendable tool,
      though it might require a bit more effort upfront to style and assemble my
      components. The fact that Radix UI provides fully accessible UI
      primitives, which come without any built-in styles, hands me complete
      control over the look and feel of my projects. This makes Radix UI an
      excellent choice for me when I want to use Tailwind CSS for all my
      styling, as I don't need to override any pre-existing styles. The
      primitives of Radix UI are built to be extended, so they fit nicely into
      my approach of constructing components using Tailwind's utility classes.
